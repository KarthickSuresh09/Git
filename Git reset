Git’s reset command is powerful for undoing changes in your working directory and repository. 
It can be used in different ways depending on the “mode” you choose: --soft, --mixed, or --hard.


git reset --soft: Moves the HEAD pointer, keeps changes staged.
Use Case: --soft is helpful if you want to edit the previous commit or re-commit it with a different message.


git reset --mixed: Moves the HEAD pointer, removes changes from staging but keeps them in the working directory.
Use Case: --mixed is useful if you want to keep changes in your working directory but decide not to stage or commit them.


git reset --hard: Moves the HEAD pointer and discards changes from both staging and working directory.
Use Case: --hard is best used when you want to discard all changes and reset your project to a previous commit.


Summary:
-----------
git reset --soft: Moves the HEAD pointer, keeps changes staged.
git reset --mixed: Moves the HEAD pointer, removes changes from staging but keeps them in the working directory.
git reset --hard: Moves the HEAD pointer and discards changes from both staging and working directory.

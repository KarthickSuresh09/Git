Step 1 : creating branch
It will create branch: git branch feature-branch
It will list branch: git branch 
If you want switch a branch: git checkout feature-branch
If you want create branch & switch branch with single command : git checkout -b feature-branch
if you create one branch sub brach automatically copy a files in the master branch 


GIT MERGING
 git merge feature-branch


GIT 3WAY MERGING



GIt CONFLICT
A Git conflict (or merge conflict) occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches or 
commits because the same part of a file has been modified differently. It requires manual intervention to resolve.

Auto-merging example.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in example.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
vi "conflict file name"
hello world
<<<<<<< HEAD
this is new line added in the mater-branch
=======
this is new line of the old file
>>>>>>> feature-branch


* git blame file name
* git log --oneline --graph
